# Copilot Instructions

This repository uses GitHub Copilot with a custom instruction file located at `.github/copilot.yml`.

## Purpose
The instruction file ensures Copilot follows workspace-specific guidelines, coding standards, and best practices every time it generates or changes code.

## How It Works
- The `.github/copilot.yml` file contains rules and standards for Copilot.
- Copilot reads and applies these instructions automatically for every code generation or modification.

## Key Guidelines
- Always check for errors after making code changes.
- Update documentation and tests when code is changed.
- Avoid generating code that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, violent, or irrelevant to software engineering.
- Do not generate code that violates copyrights.
- Keep answers short and impersonal.
- Respond in English.

## Location
- The instruction file is located at `.github/copilot.yml` in the project root.

For more details, see the instruction file itself.
